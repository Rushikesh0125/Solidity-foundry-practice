```

### Design Considerations

- Constructor takes in address of voting admin and array of candidates.
- Atleast two candidates should be there in candidates array.
- Only voting admin can register voters.
- Voters can be registered before voting starts.
- Registered voters can cast votes while voting is open.
- Every voter can cast vote only once.
- Contract also consideres Zero voting scenario. No voter will be announced if zero votes casted.
- .. For More please refer comments

### Steps to Initialize the project

# Running this in submodule[assignment] might install dependecies for all submodules
# Still make sure to run this for each submodule[assignment]
make install

forge build
```

### Steps to run tests

### Steps to Run the tests ðŸ”§ <a name = "tests"></a>

> All test cases with **_`testFail`_** prefix are meant to pass when there is revert

> All test cases with **_`test`_** prefix are meant to pass when ideal conditions are mimicked

```
#To compile contracts
forge build

#To run test cases
forge test

#To run test cases with gas report
forge test --gas-report

#To see the test coverage
forge coverage
```

### Steps to run scripts

> **_Make sure you create an `.env` file_**

> **_Refer `.env.example` for env variables_**

> **_To Run scipts on sepolia_**
